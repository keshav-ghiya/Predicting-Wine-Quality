# Predicting-Wine-Quality

For this project, We used the UCI's Red Wine Quality dataset to build different classification models to predict whether a specific red wine is "good quality" or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a "quality" score somewhere in the range of 0 and 10. With the end goal of this project, We converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality”) or not.
